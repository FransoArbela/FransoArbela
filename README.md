# Samal Ibrahim

Front-end developer working mainly with React and TypeScript.

I’m currently finishing my Front-End studies at Noroff, where I build responsive web applications with API integration and structured component architecture.

Alongside that, I completed CS50 (Harvard) to strengthen my understanding of computer science fundamentals like algorithms, data structures, C programming, SQL, and backend basics with Python (Flask).

I care about writing clean code, understanding how things work under the hood, and gradually moving toward full-stack development.
