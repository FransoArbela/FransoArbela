## Reflection Report

#Rainy Days

* HTML & File Organization:
I reworked the project by cleaning up the HTML structure and rearranging the files so everything is better organized.
* CSS Simplification:
I cleaned up the CSS code, making it simpler and easier to work with.
* Design Approach:
If I had to do it again, I’d go for an even simpler, more modern design. I plan to try out layout tools like CSS Grid or Flexbox to help with this.
* Reflection:
Instead of starting from scratch, I chose to improve what I already had. This challenge taught me how to optimize and refactor my code effectively.

Project Exam 1
* Project Focus:
This project was all about APIs and JavaScript. I aimed to create reusable code blocks. Even though I’m still learning, I see this as a strong base for future work.
* Learning About APIs:
I want to understand APIs better because I wasn’t completely happy with how I used them. I plan to study better error handling and data management practices.
* HTML Structure Improvement:
I realized I need to use more semantic HTML tags and proper meta elements to make my project more accessible and boost SEO.
* Enhancing CSS Skills:
My CSS has improved, but I still want to use the :root pseudo-class more effectively and learn more advanced layout techniques.

Semester Project 1
* Reorganized File Structure:
I grouped related CSS and HTML files into folders to keep things neat and easy to manage.
* Improved HTML Structure:
I updated the HTML layout by using proper semantic tags and making sure every page has a solid structure. I also added or updated meta descriptions for better SEO.
* CSS Style Adjustments:
I fixed some styling issues that I didn’t get a chance to address during the first build.

Overall Reflection & Future Plans
What I Learned:

Every project showed me how important it is to write clean code, keep my files organized, and use the right HTML tags. I realized that even small changes can really improve the final project.
What I'm Working on Next:
* Better CSS Layouts: I want to use CSS Grid and Flexbox more effectively.
* Improved API Handling: I need to get better at managing API errors and data.
* Using Semantic HTML: I plan to use the correct HTML tags to make my projects more accessible and search engine friendly.
By working on these areas, I hope to build projects that not only look good but also work well and are easy to update in the future.
